      "DRUG_NAME": "CLOPIDOGREL",
      "WHAT_IS_IT": "Clopidogrel is an oral antiplatelet agent which prevents formation of blood clots. Platelets are blood cells that help your blood clot normally. Clopidogrel blocks platelets from sticking together and prevents them from forming harmful clots. It helps keep blood flowing smoothly in your body.",
      "WHERE_IS_IT_USED": "Clopidogrel is used to inhibit blood clots in coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, and cerebrovascular disease. It helps to prevent heart attacks and strokes in persons at high risk (recent heart attack or stroke). It is also used with aspirin to treat severe chest pain (new heart attack, unstable angina) and to keep blood vessels open and prevent blood clots after certain procedures such as percutaneous coronary intervention (angioplasty; coronary stent) or who have coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).",
      "HOW_DOES_IT_WORKS": "Clopidogrel is a prodrug that must be metabolized into an active metabolite in the liver by several hepatic CYP450 enzymes, predominantly CYP2C19. The active drug works by irreversibly inhibiting a receptor called P2Y12 on platelet cell membranes thus inhibiting platelet activation and aggregation.",
      "GENE": "CYP2C19",
      "GENE_CONTENT": "CYP2C19 is a member of cytochrome P450 gene family, which encodes for the enzyme involved in metabolism of a large number of clinically relevant drugs and drug classes such as antidepressants, benzodiazepines, mephenytoin, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), and clopidogrel. The CYP2C19 enzyme converts the prodrug clopidogrel to its active form which is important for its function. The CYP2C19 loss of function is associated with lower active metabolite exposure, decreased platelet responsiveness and increased cardiovascular event rates. Whereas, increased CYP2C19 activity leads to enhanced platelet inhibition which may lead to an increased risk of bleeding complications.",
      "PHENOTYPE": "Intermediate Metabolizer",
      "WHAT_DOES_YOUR_RESULT_MEAN": "You are identified to have a  genotype that is predicted to be an intermediate metabolizer of Clopidogrel.  This metabolizer phenotype is associated with reduced clopidogrel active metabolite formation; increased on-treatment platelet reactivity (platelet aggregation); and an increased risk of adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events.",
      "RECOMMENDATIONS": "\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003e To avoid any adverse effects, you are advised to avoid standard dose of clopidogrel (75mg), if possibe.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e Switch to alternative drugs like prasugrel and ticagrelor at standard dose if no contraindication.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e",

      "FURTHER_INTERACTING_FACTORS": "Clopidogrel response is reduced significantly if a proton pump inhibitor is co-administered with it. Some PPIs exhibit a greater effect than others, such that omeprazole (the most potent CYP2C19 inhibitor) is associated with decreased platelet inhibition by clopidogrel, while lansoprazole did not. The effect is very prominent in Normal Metabolizers as comapred to intermediate or Poor Metabolizers. ",

It can also be found in quadruple regimens for the treatment of H. pylori infections along with other antibiotics.",
      "HOW_DOES_IT_WORKS": "Hydrochloric acid (HCl) secretion in the stomach is regulated mainly by the H+/K+ ATPase of the proton pump. Pantoprazole (after conversion to active form by protonation) binds and irreversibly inactivates the H+/K+ ATPase of the proton pump. As this ATPase enzyme is implicated in accelerating the final step in the acid secretion pathway, its inactivation leads to inhibition gastric acid secretion thereby reducing the amount of acid in the stomach.",

Pantoprazole is predominantly metabolized by CYP2C19 and CYP2C19 polymorphism affects its therapeutic response in an individuals. The individuals with reduced CYP2C19 activity have lower drug elimination and have better therapeutic response to pantoprazole treatment.

Omeprazole is predominantly metabolized by CYP2C19 and CYP2C19 polymorphism affects its therapeutic response in an individuals.

The CYP2D6 variation with decreased enzyme activity leads to an increase in the sum of the plasma concentrations of aripiprazole and the active metabolite.

Doxepin exerts its antidepressant activity by increasing the availability of the neurotransmitters (5-HT and NE) within the synaptic cleft and enhances their neurotransmission by blocking their reuptake back into the presynaptic terminal. \nDoxepin also has H1 and H2 histamine receptor blocking actions, which explains the antipruritic effect of doxepin.",

      "DRUG_NAME": "SUCCINYLCOLINE",
      "WHAT_IS_IT": "Succinylcholine is a short-acting depolarizing skeletal muscle relaxant consisting of two molecules of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) linked to each other. Succinylcholine has no effect on consciousness or pain threshold, and must therefore be used in conjunction with adequate anesthesia.",
      "WHERE_IS_IT_USED": "Due to its rapid onset and short mechanism of action, succinylcholine is the drug of choice in emergencies where immediate airway management is required and in short medical procedures requiring brief periods of muscle relaxation. Succinylcholine is indicated as an adjunct to general anesthesia, to facilitate tracheal intubation, and during surgery or mechanical ventilation.",
      "HOW_DOES_IT_WORKS": "Succinylcholine binds to cholinergic receptors (like ACh) of the motor endplate causing prolonged period of membrane depolarization inducing continuous disruption that results in transient fasciculations or involuntary muscle contractions and eventually, skeletal muscle paralysis.\nIn a small percentage of the population, administration of succinylcholine can lead to an adverse effect, malignant hyperthermia, which may be due to genetic variants in RYR1 or CACNA1S genes.",
      "GENE": "RYR1",
      "GENE_CONTENT": "RYR1 is a ryanodine receptor isoform 1, a protein channel that releases calcium in the muscle, causing the muscle to contract. The variation in the RYR1 gene causes the muscles to be very sensitive to some medications like neuromuscular blocker succinylcholine based anesthetics. The individuals who have inherited a known malignant hyperthermia-causative variant (also called pathogenic variant) in the RYR1 gene are susceptible to developing malignant hyperthermia when exposed to the depolarizing neuromuscular blocker succinylcholine .",

      "HOW_DOES_IT_WORKS": "Tamoxifen inhibits binding of estrogen to its receptor, which is critical for it\u0027s activity in breast cancer cells. Tamoxifen leads to a decrease in TGF-α and ILGF-1, and an increase in SHBG that limits the amount of freely available estradiol. These changes reduce levels of tumor growth promoting factors. Tamoxifen has also been shown to induce apoptosis in estrogen receptor positive cells.",

CYP2D6 gene plays an important role in metabolizing tamoxifen by product to active endoxifen. Patients with CYP2D6 gene variant showed reduced or no enzyme activity, and will have very low level of endoxifen. This may result in treatment failure or toxicity and hence alternative treatment is suggested.",
