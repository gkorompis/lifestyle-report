      "DRUG_NAME": "CLOPIDOGREL",
      "WHAT_IS_IT": "Clopidogrel is an oral antiplatelet agent which prevents formation of blood clots. Platelets are blood cells that help your blood clot normally. Clopidogrel blocks platelets from sticking together and prevents them from forming harmful clots. It helps keep blood flowing smoothly in your body.",
      "WHERE_IS_IT_USED": "Clopidogrel is used to inhibit blood clots in coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, and cerebrovascular disease. It helps to prevent heart attacks and strokes in persons at high risk (recent heart attack or stroke). It is also used with aspirin to treat severe chest pain (new heart attack, unstable angina) and to keep blood vessels open and prevent blood clots after certain procedures such as percutaneous coronary intervention (angioplasty; coronary stent) or who have coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).",
      "HOW_DOES_IT_WORKS": "Clopidogrel is a prodrug that must be metabolized into an active metabolite in the liver by several hepatic CYP450 enzymes, predominantly CYP2C19. The active drug works by irreversibly inhibiting a receptor called P2Y12 on platelet cell membranes thus inhibiting platelet activation and aggregation.",
      "GENE": "CYP2C19",
      "GENE_CONTENT": "CYP2C19 is a member of cytochrome P450 gene family, which encodes for the enzyme involved in metabolism of a large number of clinically relevant drugs and drug classes such as antidepressants, benzodiazepines, mephenytoin, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), and clopidogrel. The CYP2C19 enzyme converts the prodrug clopidogrel to its active form which is important for its function. The CYP2C19 loss of function is associated with lower active metabolite exposure, decreased platelet responsiveness and increased cardiovascular event rates. Whereas, increased CYP2C19 activity leads to enhanced platelet inhibition which may lead to an increased risk of bleeding complications.",
      "PHENOTYPE": "Intermediate Metabolizer",
      "WHAT_DOES_YOUR_RESULT_MEAN": "You are identified to have a  genotype that is predicted to be an intermediate metabolizer of Clopidogrel.  This metabolizer phenotype is associated with reduced clopidogrel active metabolite formation; increased on-treatment platelet reactivity (platelet aggregation); and an increased risk of adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events.",
      "RECOMMENDATIONS": "\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003e To avoid any adverse effects, you are advised to avoid standard dose of clopidogrel (75mg), if possibe.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e Switch to alternative drugs like prasugrel and ticagrelor at standard dose if no contraindication.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e",

      "FURTHER_INTERACTING_FACTORS": "Clopidogrel response is reduced significantly if a proton pump inhibitor is co-administered with it. Some PPIs exhibit a greater effect than others, such that omeprazole (the most potent CYP2C19 inhibitor) is associated with decreased platelet inhibition by clopidogrel, while lansoprazole did not. The effect is very prominent in Normal Metabolizers as comapred to intermediate or Poor Metabolizers. ",

It can also be found in quadruple regimens for the treatment of H. pylori infections along with other antibiotics.",
      "HOW_DOES_IT_WORKS": "Hydrochloric acid (HCl) secretion in the stomach is regulated mainly by the H+/K+ ATPase of the proton pump. Pantoprazole (after conversion to active form by protonation) binds and irreversibly inactivates the H+/K+ ATPase of the proton pump. As this ATPase enzyme is implicated in accelerating the final step in the acid secretion pathway, its inactivation leads to inhibition gastric acid secretion thereby reducing the amount of acid in the stomach.",

Pantoprazole is predominantly metabolized by CYP2C19 and CYP2C19 polymorphism affects its therapeutic response in an individuals. The individuals with reduced CYP2C19 activity have lower drug elimination and have better therapeutic response to pantoprazole treatment. Whereas, increase in CYP2C19 activity demonstrates subtherapuetic exposure to pantoprazole.",

      "WHAT_DOES_YOUR_RESULT_MEAN": "The genotype identified in you is  considered to be “therapeutically advantaged‿ compared to Normal Metabolizers in terms of efficacy. However, it has been suggested that continued inhibition of acid secretion in CYP2C19 intermediate metabolizers who take pantoprazole chronically may also have a higher risk of PPI-related adverse events compared to rapid, ultrarapid or nomal metabolizers.
